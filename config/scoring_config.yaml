# SafeMap Scoring Configuration
# This file defines how safety scores are calculated

model_version: "v1.0"

# POI types and their weights in the final score
# Weights should sum to 1.0
weights:
  fire: 0.40
  hospital: 0.35
  police: 0.25

# Distance decay parameters
# Score for each POI type = 100 * exp(-distance / decay_meters)
# Lower decay_meters = score drops faster with distance
decay_meters:
  fire: 2000      # Fire response is most time-critical
  hospital: 6000  # Hospitals serve larger areas
  police: 4000    # Police patrol areas

# Grid resolution settings by zoom level
# Maps frontend zoom level to grid cell size in meters
grid_resolutions:
  5: 10000   # Country overview
  6: 5000
  7: 2500
  8: 2000
  9: 1000
  10: 500
  11: 500
  12: 250
  13: 250
  14: 100    # Local detail

# Maximum number of grid cells to return in one request
max_grid_cells: 5000

# Cache settings
cache:
  point_precision: 4      # Decimal places for point cache (4 = ~11m precision)
  grid_ttl_hours: 168     # Grid cache valid for 1 week
  point_ttl_hours: 720    # Point cache valid for 30 days
